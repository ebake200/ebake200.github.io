<h1>Top 3 SoulsBorne Games of All Time</h1>

<body>
  <p>In the past 12 years, developer FromSoftware created a multitude of masterpiece games. These games are loved by a large fanbase and started its own sub-genre known as "soulsborne" or "soulslike". The games that have their place in this genre consist of Demon Souls from 2009, the Dark Souls trilogy from 2011 to 2016, Bloodborne from 2015, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice from 2019, and Elden Ring from 2022.</p>
  <p> In this page, I will be going over my personal top 3 soulsborne game of all time. These 3 games I chose becasue of how the experince stuck with me after my first playthrough unlike any other game. (Note: This is personal preference and does not put these games higher over one another, each game is an amazing experience that are all good in their own way.) </p>
