    <p> At the 2nd spot is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. while techically not sharing common factors of a soulslike like its deep and sofisticated rpg elements, the game follows a different style prioritizing unforgiving rythmic combat and fast pased aggression. This is what seprates Sekiro from the other soulsborne titles, its clear that combat was front and center for this game and it shows. The game has a certain feel that no other game can imitate. the bosses are just as grand and memorable as bosses in dark souls 3. the only problem with sekiro is that it is too short and feels like its already over once you get used to the feel of the game. </p>
