    <p> And finally at the number 1 spot is bloodborne, This game holds the title as one of my favorite games of all time and the best soulsborne game in the series. everything about bloodborne is so unique and captivating. For example unlike the common fantasy setting seen in the souls games and elden ring, bloodbornes setting follows a dark gothic and lovecraftian setting as it starts in sprawling victorian cities slaying bloodthirsty beasts in the feiry streets, but takes an unexpected turn following cosmic horrors and an idea of eldritch gods at play in the world in game. on top of the games setting the wepaons and combat is easliy one of the best in class. its fast and aggressive as your character can dash around at high speeds. the bosses and their follwoing soundtracks are so well made.</p>
